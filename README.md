Rewritten Uni Assignment: Training a neural net to recognize handwritten numbers

It so far works with the given numbers. The only problem is that I lack the motivation to further optimize my code. In C++ this was much faster. It takes 24hrs with my Laptop to train my net. 

This is a neural network consisting of 3 Layers. It takes 784 inputs which are normed to 1 and are to represent a 28x28 array of handwritten numbers.
